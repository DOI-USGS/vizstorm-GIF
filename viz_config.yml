# Change will cause refetch of entire nhdplus for view_polygon
# This is input to sf::st_simplify on the NHDPlus flowlines that
# are downloaded by the fetcher that uses it. Reduce it if you
# are going to reduce simplification_tolerance_m below it.
# a value of about 30m will have no affect on the data anything
# greater will remove increasingly more curvature from lines.
